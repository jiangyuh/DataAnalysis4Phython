Search and Save Data:

1. Using searchScript.py to search and save data
Eg:
python /Users/apple/DataAnalysisPython/Midterm/searchScript.py -t python -q1 i -q2 i -q3 i -q4 i -q5 i

-t: Argument to choose one topic from java, c, c++, c#, or python 
(if the user do not choose the topic above it will not work)

-q1: Argument to search data about question one
-q2: Argument to search data about question two
-q3: Argument to search data about question three
-q4: Argument to search data about question four
-q5: Argument to search data about question five

(User could enter some of them or all of them, if user enters nothing, no data will be gathered.)

Analysis:

2. Using analysisScript.py to print analysis of the data

Eg:python /Users/apple/DataAnalysisPython/Midterm/analysisScript.py -t python

-t: Argument the user chose before and should not be empty.

(The analysis will only show the result of the data user saved before)

All the result will show in result.html in a folder named as date.
